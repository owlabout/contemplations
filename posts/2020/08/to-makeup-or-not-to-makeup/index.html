Everyone had been looking at me without for weeks. Why go back? Let's go through some pros and cons.</p> <hr> <h3>Pro: I feel better without make-up</h3> <p>Especially after getting used to not wearing make-up during home-office, I've started rubbing my eyes every now and then again. What a wonderful sensation. I also enjoy being able to wash my face off with water, without ending up with either sticky or runny lashes.</p> <h3>Con: I feel better with make-up</h3> <p>Every once and awhile I feel empty with no lashes. Being blond, they really hardly exist if I don't ad some artificial color to them. If someone takes a picture of me I really loathe looking at it, if I wasn't wearing any make-up at all. I look tired. And worn out. And less good.</p> <h3>Pro: The surprise effect</h3> <p>If people get to know me mainly without any make-up at all, it makes it very simple to dress up for special events. I can just add a minimal amount of make-up. The contrast, to what I normally look like will be so big, that I can already fake glamour-level while actually being at casual-level.</p> <h3>Con: The surprise effect</h3> <p>When people say "wow, you look amazing", when all you did was put on minimal make-up, it really makes you question your non-make-up look. Like, wow, it must be bad.</p> <h3>Pro: The I-Don't-Care-What-People-Think vibe</h3> <p>I've often admired women, that just go through life without make-up. Especially the blonds, who like me, have see-through lashes. It's so natural and down-to-earth. These girls often exude a nice, I am comfortable with who I am vibe. I don't need your validation. Isn't that the kind of person I would like to be?</p> <h3>Con: The I-Don't-Care-What-People-Think vibe</h3> <p>The thing is ... I'm not always comfortable with who I am, I still sometimes long for a bit of validation and I do care what people think. And do I really want them to think "oh wow, she really doesn't give a fuck"?</p> <h3>Pro: Less attention from men</h3> <p>I have the feeling I get let winks and looks when I don't wear make-up.</p> <h3>Con: Less attention from men</h3> <p>I have the feeling I get let winks and looks when I don't wear make-up.</p> <hr> <p>It seems I can't do it right either way.</p> </div> <div class="footer-container svelte-8fy71"> <footer class=svelte-zix6vx> <div class="svelte-zix6vx container"> <a href=https://owlabout.de/impressum.html class=svelte-zix6vx rel=noopener>Impressum</a> <a href=https://owlabout.de/datenschutz.html class=svelte-zix6vx rel=noopener> Datenschutz </a> <span class="svelte-zix6vx footnote-container">Datenschutz ist toll!</span> <a href=https://owlabout.de/#contact class=svelte-zix6vx rel=noopener>Kontakt</a> <a href=https://owlabout.de/ class=svelte-zix6vx rel=noopener> <img alt=owlabout class=svelte-zix6vx src=/app/logo-owl.png> </a> </div> </footer> </div> </main> </div></div> <script>__SAPPER__={baseUrl:"",preloaded:[void 0,null,null,null,(function(a,b){return {post:{title:a,metadata:{slug:"to-makeup-or-not-to-makeup",link:"\u002Fposts\u002F2020\u002F08\u002Fto-makeup-or-not-to-makeup",dateString:"08.08.2020",date:"2020-08-08T00:00:00.000Z",author:"Rebecca",lang:"en",thumbnail:b,background:b,colorLeft:"rgba(121,61,61,1)",colorRight:"rgba(242,242,242,0)",title:a,file:"posts\u002F200807_makeup\u002Fto-makeup-or-not-to-makeup.md"},html:"\u003Ch1\u003ETo make-up or not to make-up\u003C\u002Fh1\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPutting on a bit of mascara before I leave the house has been a force of habit for a very long time.
