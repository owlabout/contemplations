# Heroes - so very inspirational

I came across one of these pretentious motivational posters the other day. The one that says "be the hero of your own story." That's some inspirational stuff. Naturally, I immediately ran home, changed into some tights, tied on a cape and have been roaming the streets defeating bad-guys vigilante-style ever since.

Well, no. But it did get me thinking about what someone might actually mean by saying that. What would I have to do to take this life-changing advice?

In literature, the hero of a story can mean nothing more than the main character. "Be the main character of your own story" just doesn't have the same ring to it, though. It also seems kind of self-evident. You'll rarely hear a story where that isn't the case. Just imagine meeting someone accidentally. Let's call him Greg. You and Greg decide to grab a cup of coffee together and at some point, you ask: "so, what's your story?". And then Greg proceeds to tell you a story that completely revolves around the barista you both just bought coffee from, where Greg's only role in the story is buying said cup of coffee. That would just be weird. I mean yes, the barista seems to have had an incredible life so far, saving babies from burning buildings, finding the cure to cancer, single-handedly diverting the climate-change crisis and winding down after a long week by selling coffee to the likes of Greg on the week-ends. But still, weird.

A Hero might also mean a super-hero. But that seems like overdoing it. After all, we can't all just turn into super-heroes. That would require us to all get bitten by a radioactive spider or, at the very least, be extremely rich. But unfortunately no real-world superpower sightings have been reported and proven <span class="footnote">1<span data="1" class="footnote-container">or at least that's what the government wants us to think</span></span>, and I don't see Jeff Bezos giving me full access to his fortune any time soon. Besides, the word "super-hero" is even semantically an exaggeration of a hero. We're obviously looking for the normal, mortal heroes.

:::footnote Testing

The Cambridge Dictionary defines the word hero as "a person who is admired for having done something very brave or having achieved something great." That seems simple enough. My two-year-old nephew totally admired me the other day when I was brave enough to stand on a skateboard and even managed to push myself forwards two meters without falling down! Hero-status: accomplished! What? You don't think that was very heroic? Well, that's typical. Haters gonna hate. Heroes can't be loved by everyone after all.

Or can they?

I decided to see what Hollywood has to say on the subject. When I searched for "greatest movie heroes", Google obligingly gave me the most cliché list of Movies about heroes: Die Hard, Star Wars, Robin Hood, Captain America, Zorro, Iron Man, Superman, and Indiana Jones. From looking at that list, you might conclude, that to be a hero you have to:

1. Be hot
2. Be a guy
3. Be the only one that _can_ save everyone
4. Use violence
5. Act alone

Ok, the first one I'll put off to Hollywood. Almost everyone in Hollywood has to be hot. Even the bad guys are often hot. That's a problem in itself, but one I'm not going to get into right now. And I'll smoothly slide over the second one, because I really didn't want to make this post a gender-equality rant [even though I'm reeeaally itching to jump into a long rant of how these movies always revolve around a guy heroically saving the world, while some girl beautifully faints into his arms making sure that every guy learns that being male is awesome and every girl learns that, well, men are awesome], so let's pretend that Captain America's name is Stephanie Rogers or something.

But the last three points, I found totally fascinating [As fascinating as you can find something, that you came up with yourself...]. A hero is a guy, that either is the only one who, from the beginning, has the skills do fulfill the quest, or perchance lands in a situation where he is the only one left to do the job. He then violently defeats the villain completely on his own, without asking for help. And this is what we grew up with. These are the heroes that we have perceived as “cool”. [Except maybe Captain America. She's just overly patriotic.]
This is what our generation has idolized.
Are these though really the heroes that we want to see in the world?
And at the same time, is this really the hero that I would want to be? It seems awfully lonely.

But in the end, isn't that what we do all the time? I don't mean being heroic. We're definitely not all doing that. I mean valuing egotism over teamwork. We all thought it was very impressive that Greg's barista single-handedly reversed the climate-change. But would we have been equally impressed, if Greg's barista had asked lots of people for help, so that, in the end, the human race was saved by a group of 53 people? Maybe, maybe not.

I myself have been know to not be able to accept a compliment, but instead, shrug it off with the words "I had a lot of help". As if that as a bad thing.
